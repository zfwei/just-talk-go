# Just Talk

[中文](README.md)

Just Talk is a desktop voice input tool. It records audio with a global hotkey, sends it to streaming ASR, and then copies the recognized text to the clipboard or submits it directly into the focused input field.

It is built for people who want to type less and speak more while coding, chatting, writing notes, or working with long text.

## Features

- Global hotkey recording with `toggle` and `hold` modes.
- Doubao streaming ASR with optimized bidirectional streaming and second-pass recognition.
- Clipboard copy and automatic text submission.
- Always-on-top recording status overlay for Wayland, X11, and macOS.
- TUI configuration for hotkeys, mode, auto-submit, stop delay, hotwords, and related settings.
- ASR hotwords for project names, people names, English terms, and domain-specific vocabulary.
- Usage statistics for total sessions, total recognized characters, average speed, and recent speed.

## Platform Status

The current development focus is Linux and macOS desktop support:

| Platform | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux Wayland | Supported | Works with Sway / wlroots; hotkeys use evdev and require input permissions |
| Linux X11 | Supported | Uses native X11 global hotkeys |
| macOS | Supported | Global hotkeys use CGEventTap, recording uses CoreAudio, clipboard uses NSPasteboard, and overlay uses AppKit NSPanel |
| Windows | Not implemented | Not supported yet |

## Build

Just Talk uses native platform APIs, so builds require cgo.

Linux build dependencies:

```bash
# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S --needed go gcc libx11 libxtst libxext wayland

# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install golang-go build-essential libx11-dev libxtst-dev libxext-dev libxinerama-dev libwayland-dev
```

macOS build dependencies:

```bash
# Apple Command Line Tools provide clang and the macOS SDK. Full Xcode is not required.
xcode-select --install
```

Build for the current platform:

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o build/just-talk ./cmd/just-talk
```

Install to `~/.local/bin/just-talk`:

```bash
build/just-talk --install
# or
make install
```

macOS must be built on macOS. The project does not provide a non-cgo build.

## Usage

Start the TUI:

```bash
just-talk
```

Run without the TUI:

```bash
just-talk --no-tui
```

Force a backend:

```bash
just-talk --backend wayland
just-talk --backend x11
```

## Configuration

Default config path:

```text
~/.config/just-talk/config.toml
```

Hotword example:

```toml
[voice]
hotwords = ["Wayland", "Sway", "wl-copy", "wtype", "just-talk-go"]
```

macOS hotkey example:

```toml
[voice]
# Option is Alt; Command/Cmd is Super.
push_to_talk = "Option+Command"
```
