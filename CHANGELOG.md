# Changelog

All notable project changes are tracked here.

## Unreleased

- Added Windows platform support with native low-level keyboard hooks (WH_KEYBOARD_LL) for global hotkeys, native Win32 API clipboard, auto-submit/simulate-paste (SendInput Ctrl+V), and Windows doctor checks.
- Fixed Win32 INPUT structure layout and size alignment in autotype on Windows to make SendInput and auto-submit (自动上屏) work correctly.
- Clarified README build and install setup steps for the repository directory and `~/.local/bin` PATH.
- Restricted voice hotkeys to non-text global shortcut keys, rejecting letters, digits, punctuation, Space, and similar text-producing keys.
- Avoid duplicate auto-submit on KDE Plasma by using uinput directly and not writing the Wayland primary selection there.
- TUI is now the default startup mode.
- Added persistent usage statistics for total sessions, recognized characters, average speed, and recent speed.
- Added configurable ASR hotwords.
- Added TUI help toggle with `h`.
- Improved Wayland clipboard and auto-submit behavior with `wl-copy` and `wtype`.
- Added Linux recording status overlay for X11 and Wayland.
- Added macOS support for global hotkeys, native recording, clipboard, auto-submit, recording status overlay, and environment checks.
- Removed non-cgo macOS fallback builds; Just Talk now requires cgo for native platform integration.
- Replaced the old Claude-specific agent guide with `AGENTS.md` and clarified build documentation.
- Improved toggle and hold hotkey behavior for fast repeated key presses.
- Show ASR connection and final-result timeout errors in the status UI/overlay instead of immediately falling back to idle.
- Added transient `Esc` cancel and `R` retry hotkeys while recording or showing retryable errors.
- Improved X11 overlay placement on multi-monitor setups and switched X11 rendering to an ARGB window for smoother rounded corners.
- Fixed a Wayland overlay shutdown race that could crash while closing the app, and surfaced Linux `arecord` microphone/device failures in the UI.
- Made `Esc` cancel active overlay states, including the final ASR wait state, and suppress output from canceled pending sessions.
- Improved Wayland overlay rounded-corner antialiasing, especially on KDE Plasma.
- Added `just-talk --install` and `make install` to install the binary into `~/.local/bin`.
